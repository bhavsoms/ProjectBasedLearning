# Data Preprocessing App Documentation

## Overview
The Data Preprocessing App is a Streamlit application designed to assist users in preprocessing their data. It allows users to upload a CSV file, handle null values, encode categorical columns, and visualize the preprocessed data with histograms or pie charts. Users can also download the preprocessed data as a CSV file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
    pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. Clone or download this repository.

## Running the App
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `app.py` file.
3. Run the following command:
   streamlit run app.py
   4. The app will open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can manually open a browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal.

## Using the App
### Uploading a CSV File
1. Click on the "Choose a CSV file" button.
2. Select the CSV file you wish to preprocess.
3. The first few rows of the uploaded data will be displayed.

### Handling Null Values
1. Select the method to handle null values from the dropdown menu.
2. If you choose "Constant", enter the constant value for imputation.
3. The data with null values handled will be displayed.

### Encoding Categorical Columns
1. Select the categorical columns you wish to encode.
2. The data with encoded categorical columns will be displayed.

### Visualizing Data
1. Select the type of visualization from the dropdown menu.
2. If you selected "Histogram", choose a numerical feature to visualize.
3. If you selected "Pie Chart", choose a categorical feature to visualize.
4. The selected visualization will be displayed.

### Downloading Preprocessed Data
1. Click on the "Download preprocessed data" button.
2. The preprocessed data will be downloaded as a CSV file.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter a KeyError when trying to visualize data, ensure that the selected feature exists in the DataFrame and is correctly spelled.
- If the app does not run, ensure that all required libraries are installed and that you are using a compatible version of Python.
