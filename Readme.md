**Image Steganography with Tkinter**

This project implements a basic image steganography application using Python's Tkinter library for graphical user interface (GUI) development. It allows users to hide text messages within the least significant bits (LSBs) of image files and extract the hidden data later.

**Key Features:**

* **Encode:** Embeds a user-provided text message within a selected image.
* **Decode:** Extracts the hidden text from an image containing steganographic data.
* **User-Friendly GUI:** Provides clear instructions and visual elements for easy interaction.
* **Error Handling:** Includes basic checks for user input and file selection.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Tkinter (GUI library)
* PIL (Pillow Fork) for image manipulation
* tkinter.filedialog (for file selection)
* tkinter.messagebox (for pop-up messages)

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3 and the required libraries installed (`pip install tkinter pillow`).
2. **Running the Code:** Save the code as `image_steganography.py` and execute it from your terminal using `python image_steganography.py`.

**User Guide:**

* The GUI displays an introductory screen with title and developer information.
* Use the "Encode" button to hide a message within an image.
    * Select an image file using the file dialog.
    * Enter the text message you want to hide in the provided text area.
    * Click "Encode" to embed the message in the image. A success message will be displayed, and the encoded image will be saved as `Image_with_hiddentext.png` in the same directory.
* Use the "Decode" button to extract hidden data from an image.
    * Select an image that potentially contains hidden data.
    * Click "Decode" to reveal the hidden text message. It will be displayed in a text box.

**Limitations:**

* This implementation hides data in the LSBs of the image, which may be susceptible to steganalysis techniques if a large amount of data is hidden.
* The size of the hidden message is limited by the available LSBs in the image.
* Error handling is basic and can be further enhanced.

**Further Development:**

* Implement more sophisticated data hiding techniques.
* Support for different image formats (e.g., JPEG, BMP).
* Password protection for encoded messages.
* Improved error handling and user feedback.
