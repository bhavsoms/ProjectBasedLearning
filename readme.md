## YouTube Transcript Summarization with TF-IDF

This Python script retrieves a YouTube video transcript using the `youtube_transcript_api` library, preprocesses the text, and generates a summarized version using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). It also performs basic plagiarism and precision checks on the generated summary.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3
* `youtube_transcript_api` library (`pip install youtube_transcript_api`)
* `nltk` library (`pip install nltk`)

**Instructions:**

1. Download the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install youtube_transcript_api nltk
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python youtube_transcript_summarizer.py
   ```
3. Enter the YouTube video link when prompted.

**Functionality:**

* Prompts the user for a YouTube video link.
* Extracts the transcript using the `youtube_transcript_api`.
* Preprocesses the transcript by:
    * Joining text lines.
    * Removing newline characters.
    * Tokenizing sentences.
    * Applying stop word removal and stemming.
* Creates a TF-IDF matrix to identify important keywords within the transcript.
* Scores each sentence based on its TF-IDF value.
* Generates a summary by selecting sentences exceeding a weighted average score threshold.
* Calculates Jaccard similarity between the summary and original text as a basic plagiarism check.
* Calculates ROUGE score to assess the precision of the summary.

**Limitations:**

* The TF-IDF summarization approach is a basic implementation and may not capture the full context of the video.
* The plagiarism check using Jaccard similarity is a simplified measure and doesn't guarantee originality.
* The ROUGE score only measures overlap in word n-grams and doesn't capture semantic similarity.

**Further Enhancements:**

* Explore more sophisticated summarization techniques (e.g., LexRank).
* Implement advanced plagiarism detection methods.
* Incorporate user preferences for summary length or focus.
* Visualize the keywords or keyphrases extracted through TF-IDF.
